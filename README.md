# Data8
Project 1: World Progress
In this project, you'll explore data from Gapminder.org, a website dedicated to providing a fact-based view of the world and how it has changed. That site includes several data visualizations and presentations, but also publishes the raw data that we will use in this project to recreate and extend some of their most famous visualizations.

The Gapminder website collects data from many sources and compiles them into tables that describe many countries around the world. All of the data they aggregate are published in the Systema Globalis. Their goal is "to compile all public statistics; Social, Economic and Environmental; into a comparable total dataset." All data sets in this project are copied directly from the Systema Globalis without any changes.

This project is dedicated to Hans Rosling (1948-2017), who championed the use of data to understand and prioritize global development challenges.

Project 2: Cardiovascular Disease: Causes, Treatment, and Prevention
In this project, you will investigate the major causes of death in the world: cardiovascular disease!
In the following analysis, we will investigate the world's most dangerous killer: Cardiovascular Disease. Your investigation will take you across decades of medical research, and you'll look at multiple causes and effects across four different studies.
Here is a roadmap for this project:

In Part 1, we'll investigate the major causes of death in the world during the past century (from 1900 to 2015).
In Part 2, we'll look at data from the Framingham Heart Study, an observational study into cardiovascular health.
In Part 3, we'll examine the effect that hormone replacement therapy has on the risk of coronary heart disease for post-menopausal women using data from the Nurses' Heart Study and Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study.
In Part 4, we'll explore the effect that the consumption of saturated fats has on cardiovascular death rates using data from the National Heart-Diet Study

Project 3: Movie Classification
Welcome to the third project of Data 8! You will build a classifier that guesses whether a movie is romance or action, using only the number of times words appear in the movies's screenplay. By the end of the project, you should know how to:

Build a k-nearest-neighbors classifier.
Test a classifier on data.
